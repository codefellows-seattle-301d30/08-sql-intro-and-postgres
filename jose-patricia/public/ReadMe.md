# SQL and PostgreSQL

**Author**: Jose Flores and Patricia Raftery
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This application is a website to display hundreds of blog entries. Our problem domain is to create a server and create a database, and display the blog articles from the database to the client.

## Getting Started

Start by forking and cloning the starter code from GitHub. Familiarize yourself with the code. Init npm, install express, and nodemon is optional. Make the database, and make a table. Populate the table with the 250 blog articles. Modify as desired.

## Architecture

This application works by using Javascript, Markdown, Css, Html, JSON, jQuery, Handlebars, and AJAX. This application takes the blog articles from hackerIpsum.json, from the database and displays client-side. We also used express.
