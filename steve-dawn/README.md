SQL intro into Postgres

**Author**: Dawn Aldrich, Steve Starwalt
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
As a user, I want to store my articles in a database so that my articles are available for users from an external source.
As a developer, I want to write proper SQL queries so that I can interact with the blog articles in my database.
As a developer, I want to review my code base so that I have a deep understanding of its overall functionality.


## Getting Started
Get the starter code from the seattle-301d30 org repo. Install the npm express node package including the body-parser, link to jQuery, AJAX, handlebars and get postgresSQL installed and running. Attend the Code Fellows 301 course.

## Architecture
This uses Handlebars and SMACSS in the HTML to render the pages.  The HTML is manipulated by using jQuery.  The data is persisted in a SQL database and stored in local storage on page load to endsure a better user experience.
